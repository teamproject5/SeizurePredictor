Seizure Predictor is here to be your helpful, guiding hand. As someone experiencing seizures, it is important to have hte ability to monitor your well-being, to ensure that you live a risk-free and healthy life. As it is known that seizures can occur unexpectedly, Seizure Predictor is here to help signify if brain activity measured by your EEG device is at levels indicating a seizure is about to occur. When having the Seizure Predictor by your side, you will have the proper amount of time to stop what you are doing to achieve a safe position before anything dangerous may occur.<br><br>
Although the Seizure Predictor attempts to be as accurate as possible while analyzing the data, the given result is at most one minute old. This means that your personal EEG recorder sends data to the Seizure Predictor service every 60 seconds. This is expected to improve in the next release of the service.<br><br>
